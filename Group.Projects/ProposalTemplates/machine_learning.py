  - *Mitigation*: Use cross-validation, regularization techniques, and keep a separate test set for final evaluation.

- **Computational Resources**:
  - *Risk*: Training complex models, especially deep learning models, may require significant computational power.
  - *Mitigation*: Utilize cloud services or GPUs if necessary, and optimize code for efficiency.

- **Project Scope Creep**:

Additional Considerations:
- **Ethical AI Practices**:
  - Ensure the model does not perpetuate biases present in the data.
  - Include fairness metrics and consider ethical implications of predictions.

- **Data Privacy**:
